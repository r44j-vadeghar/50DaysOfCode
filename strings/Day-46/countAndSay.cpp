/*
    Given a positive integer n, return the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.
    The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:
    countAndSay(1) = "1"
    countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string.
    To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the same character. 
    Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. 
    To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.
    Example 1:
        Input: n = 1
        Output: "1"
        Explanation: This is the base case.
    Example 2:
        Input: n = 4
        Output: "1211"
        Explanation:
        countAndSay(1) = "1"
        countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
        countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
        countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
